## Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering
## Tools Used
-  Python
-  Pandas
-  Scikit-learn
-  Matplotlib
-  Seaborn
## Dataset
*  Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset
## Steps
1. Loaded the Mall Customer dataset
2. Inspected income and spending score columns
3. Dropped the CustomerID column
4. Applied StandardScaler for feature normalization
5. Implemented KMeans clustering for different values of K
6. Plotted the Elbow Curve to determine optimal clusters
7. Trained KMeans model with selected K value
8. Assigned cluster labels to customers
9. Visualized customer clusters using scatter plot
10. Interpreted and labeled each customer segment
## Model Used
1. KMeans Clustering
2. Distance Metric: Euclidean Distance
3. Optimal K selected using Elbow Method
## Evaluation & Visualization
-  Elbow Plot (Inertia vs Number of Clusters)
-  Cluster Visualization using scatter plot
-  Color-coded customer segments
## Customer Segments Identified
-  High Income – High Spending Customers
-  Hih Income – Low Spending Customers
-  Low Income – High Spending Customers
-  Low Income – Low Spending Customers
-  Average Income – Average Spending Customers
## Outcome
-  Learned unsupervised learning using KMeans clustering.
-  Understood the importance of feature scaling in distance-based algorithms.
-  Gained practical experience in business-oriented customer segmentation.
